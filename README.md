# Analyze_Poem
Using this python script, you can analyze and obtain some simple informations about a poem. It will also return how long the script took to run.

As an example, I analized the poem "The road not taken" by Robert Frost.
This is the result I have obtained:

prosody: [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 6, 8, 8, 9, 10, 7, 11, 11, 12, 9, 13]\
module: None\
lengths: [10, 9, 10, 11, 9, 0, 9, 10, 10, 9, 9, 0, 9, 10, 10, 9, 12, 0, 10, 10, 10, 9, 10]\
finals: ['d', 'th', 'd', 'ld', 'wth', 'r', 'm', 'r', 're', 'me', 'lay', 'ck', 'rday', 'way', 'ck', 'gh', 'nce', 'ndi', 'dby', 'nce']
